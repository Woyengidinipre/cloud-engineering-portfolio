# Resume Point - Week of [Date]

## Current Status
- **Infrastructure**: VPC deployed to AWS
- **Backend**: Code written with MySQL integration (not tested yet)
- **Frontend**: React app created
- **Docker**: All services containerized
- **Database**: MySQL container configured but integration not verified

## What Was In Progress
We were testing the database integration. The backend code is updated to connect to MySQL, but we haven't verified it works yet.

## To Resume Next Week

### 1. Start Docker Containers
\\\powershell
cd C:\Users\Woyengidinipre\cloud-engineering-portfolio\project-01-three-tier-app
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
\\\

### 2. Test Database Integration
\\\powershell
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Get users (empty initially)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users

# Create test user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{\"name\":\"Test User\",\"email\":\"test@example.com\"}'
\\\

### 3. Next Major Steps
- [ ] Verify MySQL integration works
- [ ] Deploy to AWS RDS (real database)
- [ ] Deploy containers to ECS
- [ ] Add Application Load Balancer
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch monitoring
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline

## Questions to Answer When Resuming
- Did you learn anything from Brimman's book that changes how we should approach this?
- Any Terraform best practices you want to implement?
- Ready to tackle AWS deployment?

## Resources
- GitHub: https://github.com/[your-username]/cloud-engineering-portfolio
- AWS Console: Infrastructure → VPC (already deployed)
- Docker: All services defined in docker-compose.yml
